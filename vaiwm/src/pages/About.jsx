              A Ministry Beyond the Walls

                Victoria-Alabaster International Women Ministry is not a church—it is a call to the field.
              </p>
              <p className="text-green-900">
                The vision was birthed in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2007. Prior to my ordination, during an interview with my spiritual father in ministry, I shared a conviction that has remained the foundation of this work: “I am a field worker, not just for the church.” That calling shaped the mission and purpose of this ministry.
              </p>
              <p className="text-green-900">
                Although the work paused in 2009 following my relocation to the United States, the call never faded. On February 8, 2022, the ministry was relaunched in Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria, with eight women gathered in faith, hope, and purpose. What began as a small gathering has continued to grow into a ministry of empowerment, compassion, and transformation.
